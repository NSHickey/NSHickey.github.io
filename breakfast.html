				<p style="font-size:130%;">It is said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I am not a nutritionist, so I cannot verify the truthfulness of that statement. 
					However, I know that a delicious breakfast can make your day better. When I can, I enjoy having eggs for breakfast. Eggs are delicious and versatile.
					They can be boiled, fried, scrambled, and even made into an omelet. If you are unsure what to have for breakfast today, consider making yourself some eggs.</p>
