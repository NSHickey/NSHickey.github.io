				<p>My name is Noah Hickey and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
					This website will hopefully provide some small insight into who I am and not be overly painful to look at. 
					Follow the links on this homepage to read a breakfast and book recommendation from me.</p>

				<p style="font-size:160%;">This space was feeling empty, so I thought I would expand on my photo. When I was working overseas, I had an opportunity to take a vacation, 
					so I went on a multipart vacation visiting Taiwan and Singapore. I had a wonderful time, visiting new places and trying new foods. 
					Hopefully, this section of the homepage feels a little more filled in now.</p>
