				<p style="font-size:130%;">I recently finished reading <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury. It is a lesser-known work of dystopic fiction compared to George Orwell's <i>1984</i>, 
					but still a literary classic with unique ideas. Written in 1953, the writing of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> feels somewhat dated. However, the setting 
					and concepts explored within the novel are unique and still feel relevant today. If you have not done so, I recommend reading <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>; 
					it is an easy and enjoyable read.</p>
